#Higher Order Functions: Exercises and Processing Data

hoffy.js - Write a series of functions that demonstrate the use of the rest operator (or call/apply), and higher order functions

bnbfunc.js and report.js - Print out a report analyzing AirBnb listing data. There are two parts to this:

* An initial version that works off of a local JSON file
* A second version that works off of remote urls and additional data (you can overwrite the previous part with this code)
